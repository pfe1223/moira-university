This repo is inspired by a recent [Arx](https://www.twitch.tv/arx_uk) stream in which he said something along the lines of:

>You should not try to copy my gameplay. Instead, you should look for the little things I do and implement those.

## Orbs

* **Flat Bounce** - Throw healing orbs against a flat surface so that you maximize the healing on the bounce back.
* **Healing Zone** - Similar to a flat bounce, you can throw a healing orb flat against the floor so that it bounces against the ceiling. The short flight path ensures you are almost always getting healing from the orb. This helps you tank damage. Healing zones must be done in a smaller room.

## Fades

* **Reposition Fade** - Fade to used to reposition yourself within a fight. This fade may help keep you alive, but the goal is to remain engaged in the fight instead of disengaging. [Link](https://www.tiktok.com/@arx_uk/video/7173387435668147462?is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7173387435668147462)
